Version 2 of the tooling has
  * A default venue at the top
  * L1 headings are venues
  * L2 headings are questions/tasks - with the following task types
    - gift      (markdown)
    - essay     (markdown)
    - tex-essay

Outputs are:
  * md files for each venue
  * tex/pdf files for each venue
  * moodle gift file storing each venue in filename/topic category
  * moodle xml file storing each venue in filename/topic category
  * md file for the whole thing
  * tex/pdf file for the whole thing

Current issues:
  * tex-essay questions are only going to tex/pdf outputs
  * gift questions are gift only to gift outputs
  * essay questions are going to xml output.
  * If the base64 encoding includes an equal symbol and that image is in an answer, it messes up the gift parser - I'm just adjusting by hand for now but I did fix that in my v1 tooling so I should go back and take a look at that img \ thing.  On that version I had a different <img/> tag to use in answers that would escape the equals symbol.  Don't love that, but in this case I know exactly when I am in the answers so perhaps I can do that automatically?
  * I need a way to control the size of images in a tex document better.

I think just getting tex-essay questions into xml output gets me to where I need to be. It is begin sent there via pandoc's conversion to md but it is not up to scratch if I actually haed to use it for something.  The treatment of images is perhaps the problem since I _don't_ put `scr` in for image tags but I do for `tex-essay` where I use `\includegraphics`.  I need to standardise before I can get tex-essay questions into xml output.
