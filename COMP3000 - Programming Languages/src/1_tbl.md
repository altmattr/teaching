## Week Outline

  * What is TBL
  * Your rights and responsibilities
  * TBL Practice

## Preparation
\item None this week, but in all future weeks you will need to \emph{pre-prepare} for class.  \emph{This week only} there will be a short explanation of TBL before we begin the class for real.  In future weeks \emph{there will be not lecture at the start of class}.  You will complete the iRAT yourself \emph{before} class, then you will get into groups and complete the tRAT before we move on to the application exercise.

question: |
    Your task is to create a \emph{team contract}.  The contract should spell out:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the team name, 
    \item the team members, 
    \item expectations of each member.  
    \item conditions under which a member may be excluded.
    \item anything else you think will help the team work well together.
    \end{enumerate}

    You will be given 30 mins to work on this at which point we will re-convene to discuss the various worksheets that were created.  Your group will be expected to share your contract with the class.

    To help you out with this, I've put in an example Application Exercise which might run in a COMP1000 type course.

    \begin{note}
    \subsection*{Example Application Exercise}
    This week we learned conditionals.  We will play some code golf.  The task is to write a program which draws a circle which "bounces around" the screen as it hits the edges.  When the x-coordinate is a multiple of 3, the shape is red for 1 second, when the x co-ordinate is a multiple of 5 it is blue for one second, otherwise it is green.  The shortest code wins.

    There are quite a few conditions needed to get this code to work and you are encouraged to think about how they relate to each other in coming up with the shortest code to solve the problem.

    You will be given 45 mins to work on this at which point we will re-convene to discuss the various solutions that were created.  Your group will be expected to share your solution with the class after 1 hour.
