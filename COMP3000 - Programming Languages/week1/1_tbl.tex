\section*{Preparation}
\begin{itemize}
\item None this week, but in all future weeks you will need to \emph{pre-prepare} for class.  \emph{This week only} there will be a short explanation of TBL before we begin the class for real.  In future weeks \emph{there will be not lecture at the start of class}.  You will complete the iRAT yourself \emph{before} class, then you will get into groups and complete the tRAT before we move on to the application exercise.
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\part*{Application Exercise 1}
Your task is to create a \emph{team contract}.  The contract should spell out:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the team name, 
\item the team members, 
\item expectations of each member.  
\item conditions under which a member may be excluded.
\item anything else you think will help the team work well together.
\end{enumerate}

You will be given 1 hour to work on this at which point we will re-convene to discuss the various worksheets that were created.  Your group will be expected to share your contract with the class after 1 hour.

\newpage
\part*{Self Study Exercises 1}

There are none this week, but in each future week you will be provided with a set of self-study exercises specifically designed to support you in preparing for the final exam.
